 courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity, 
 classification, grade, position)

-- a) Functional dependencies --

# REMOVE THIS LINE AND REPLACE IT WITH FDS ON THE FORM: a b -> c

Functional dependencies:
Students
4   studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName


Courses
8   courseCode -> courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity
    
Program
9   programName -> programAbbreviation
  
Department
11    departmentName -> departmentAbbreviation
      departmentAbbreviation -> departmentName

Taken
12   studentIdnr, courseCode -> grade

WaitingList
14    studentIdnr, courseCode -> position
        position, courseCode -> studentIdnr

LimitedCourses
15    courseCode -> capacity
    
    



-- b) BCNF schema --

# REMOVE THESE LINES AND REPLACE IT WITH A SCHEMA IN BCNF
# (use _underscore_ to mark keys, like in the ER-schema)

Table 1 (_programName_, programAbbreviation) 
fd: programName -> programAbbreviation

Table 2 (_studentIdnr_, studentName, login, branchName, programName) 
fd: studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName

Table 3 (_departmentAbbreviation_, departmentName)  
fd: departmentName         -> departmentAbbreviation
    departmentAbbreviation -> departmentName

Table 4 (_courseCode_, departmentAbbreviation, courseName, credits, capacity) 
fd: courseCode -> departmentAbbreviation, courseName, credits, capacity

table 5 (_courseCode_, _studentIdnr_, grade, position)
fd: courseCode, studentIdnr -> grade, position

It removed 2 redundant functional dependencies and is nicely strucured and very much alike our schema from part 1, 
the only flaw is that table 4 is a combination of Courses and LimitedCourses which isnt right for our domain description since not all are LimitedCourses
-- c) 4NF additions --

MVD identified: courseCode ->> classification, a course can have multiple classifications so its independant of the other attributes in table 4

We decompose classification and capacity to its own table:

Table 4 (_courseCode_, departmentAbbreviation, courseName, credits) 
fd: courseCode -> departmentAbbreviation, courseName, credits

Table 7 (_courseCode_, classification)
fd: _courseCode_ -> classification

table 8 (_courseCode_, capacity)
fd: _coursecode_ -> capacity
